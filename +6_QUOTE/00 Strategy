- hire-me organizes data about Employment Agencies in a City, so that one can physcially visit them after booking an appointment 
via TELELPHONE; notating the Employment Agencies' PHYSICAL ADDRESS and WEBSITE ADDRESS.
- hire-me is meant to make the process of job hunting fun by making it organized.
- Version 1 will require manual input of data, e.g. as obtained from Chat GPT.
- Future versions will automate this process by linking up with the Chat GPT API.
- There could also be other websites with APIs that can be utilized to pull data into hire-me.
