- hire-moi organizes data about Employment Agencies in a City, so that one can physcially visit them after booking an appointment 
via TELELPHONE; notating the Employment Agencies' PHYSICAL ADDRESS and WEBSITE ADDRESS. So:
+ NAME
+ PHYSICAL ADDRESS
+ TELE
+ WEBSITE ADDRESS
- hire-moi is meant to make the process of job hunting fun by making it organized.
- Version 1 will require manual input of data, e.g. as obtained from ChatGPT.
- Future versions will automate this process by linking up with the Chat GPTAPI.
- There could also be other websites with APIs that can be utilized to pull data into hire-moi.
