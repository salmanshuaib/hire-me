- NEXT STEP:
+ Enable Mirage.bas in hire-moi.xlsm to allow insertion of text via the nav panel, instead of 
having to switcn nav panel off and on again.

- LETS WRITE AN EXCEL MACRO IN VBA (VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS) CALLED "zoomer" THAT AT FIRST:

1. ESTABLISHES 10 COLUMNS IN AN EXCEL SHEET:
+ SERIAL NUMBER
+ EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
+ WEBSITE
+ TELEPHONE
+ ADDRESS
+ APPLIED ONLINE?
+ CALLED?
+ TEL APPOINTMENT?
+ INTERVIEW?
+ SUCCESS

2. Formatting:
a) Makes these column headings BOLD.
b) Table cells have a cyan fill.
c) Table cells are bordered on all sides by a thick border.


3. Prompts the user to fill out any cell, part of the table, by a sort of tkinter dialog box called "zoomer" that:
a) is launched by default.
b) can also be launched by the keys SHIFT+P.
c) the user enters the cell address that the user wishes to edit.

4. THE MACRO ALLOWS FOR IMPORT OF DATA AS INDIVIDUAL COLUMNS: INTO THE COLUMNS OF ITSELF, VIA AN IMPORT BUTTON THAT FURTHER PROMPTS THE 
user WHICH OF THE 10 COLUMNS he WISHES TO IMPORT DATA INTO.

5. The macro, , can be integrated with APIs of job-search websites.

- hire-moi organizes data about Employment Agencies in a City, so that one can physcially visit them after booking an appointment 
via TELELPHONE; notating the Employment Agencies' PHYSICAL ADDRESS and WEBSITE ADDRESS. So:
+ NAME
+ PHYSICAL ADDRESS
+ TELE
+ WEBSITE ADDRESS
- hire-moi is meant to make the process of job hunting fun by making it organized.
- Version 1 will require manual input of data, e.g. as obtained from ChatGPT.
- Future versions will automate this process by linking up with the Chat GPTAPI.
- There could also be other websites with APIs that can be utilized to pull data into hire-moi.
